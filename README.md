Silence occasionally broken by "x" the app.

Silly little app I made cause I was bored, still a bit rough around the edges

Some things to do:
- [ ] Be able to select folders (with the option to play files randomly or in order)
- [ ] Volume slider for each file
- [ ] Better UI for each file (instead of a simple list make each a component or something)
